# blackjack

> I wrote this game to practice my HTML/CSS/JS skills. Used several frameworks and libraries like cards.js and bootstrap.

## [Demo](https://adnjoo.github.io/blackjack)

## Bugs
### V2 bug: 
5 A 6 for dealer is returning 22 bust. 
It should return 12 and keep hitting.
J 3 2 A returning 26 instead of 16.
